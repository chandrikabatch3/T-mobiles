 which is still quite powerful.The handset is tipped to feature an aluminium frame, which should make the
 phone quite durable. The tipster claims the Realme GT Neo 6 will be priced under RMB 2,000 (approx Rs 22,900).

 now made an appearance on China Telecom. The listing reveals the prices, specifications and design through
